# 1. Course Introduction
Professor Kagan introduces the course and the material that will be covered during the semester. He aims to clarify what the class will focus on in particular and which subjects it will steer away from. The emphasis will be placed on philosophical questions that arise when one contemplates the nature of death. The first half of the course will address metaphysical questions while the second half will focus on value theory.

	- An opportunity to introduce students on what to expect.
	- Professors are humans too. 

# 2. The nature of persons: dualism vs. physicalism
Professor Kagan discusses the two main positions with regard to the question, "What is a person?" On the one hand, there is the dualist view, according to which a person is a body and a soul. On the other hand, the physicalist view argues that a person is just a body. The body, however, has a certain set of abilities and is capable of a large range of activities. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh-6HyTRNNY&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=2&t=0s) - Chapter 1. "Is There Life After Death?" Asking the Right Question
	- Rephrasing as a contradiction, we can answer with an obvious "No":
		- Could someone still live after their life is over?
		- Could someone not die after their death?
	- On the other hand, if we specify bodily death, we may find ourselves in a new situation where the solution is not obvious.
		- Might someone still exist after their body has died?
- [13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh-6HyTRNNY&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=2&t=805s) - Chapter 2. Ways to Conceptualize Self-Identity 
	- Dualism: Thinking of the mind as the non-physical element separate from the body.
	- Physicalism: The person is just the body with "special" properties.
- [21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh-6HyTRNNY&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=2&t=1278s) - Chapter 3. Dualists: The Body-Soul Perspective 
	- If the soul is equated to an inhabitant of a house (the body), then the soul exists despite the body's destruction.
	- Do souls exist? If they do, do we have evidence that they survive the destruction of the body? Are souls interlinked with their respective bodies then?
	- If the soul is independent of the body, does it continue to exist in perpetuum. (Plato - Phaedo)
		- But it is established that stimulating the body impacts and influences the soul. Could there be a process such that its impact on the body that results in its death can impact the soul to die as well?
- [39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh-6HyTRNNY&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=2&t=2340s) - Chapter 4. The Physicalists: The Body Is a Body and Conclusion
	- A rock is an object or a body.
	- A cell phone is an object or a body with some impressive functionalities.
	- An individual is just an object or a body that possesses some truly impressive functionalities not limited to communication, emotions, reasoning, and thinking.

# 3. Arguments for the existence of the soul, Part I
The lecture focuses on arguments that might be offered as proof for the existence of the soul. The first series of arguments discussed is those known as "inferences to the best explanation." That is, we posit the existence of things we cannot see so as to explain something else that is generally agreed to take place.
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR63MMAi-fs&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=3&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Introduction: The P-Functioning Body 
	- P as in Person. A Person that thinks, reasons, emotes, communicates, etc,.

	- When physicalists refer to the Mind, what is meant is the P-Functions.
	- For dualists, a mind is synonymous to the Soul, the intangible, non-material.

	- Positing the existence of something intangible based on the fact that said something explains another concept. Ex: Atoms explaining our world's existence.
	- The inference to the best possible explanation. Germs vs Demons in explaining an illness, where germs are a favorable explanation.
- [19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR63MMAi-fs&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=3&t=1195s) - Chapter 4. Can Only the Soul Justify Feature F? 
	- If $\exists$ a feature F that explains the existence of a Soul's separateness from the body, then the Dualists are right.
	- Is there a convincing argument to explain the existence of the soul?
	- If there is an object that determines the body's purposeful functions, then must the object be separate from the body as opposed to being a part of the body (like an executive functioning segment)?
	- Are we any different from the robots we program to perform deterministic actions? Do we really have any free will in that regard? 
	- Is the Soul a prerequisite for free will?
- [35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR63MMAi-fs&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=3&t=2107s) - Chapter 5. Abilities, Desires, Emotions -- Candidates for Feature F
	- The argument that there exist certain attributes only possessed by humans, such that it warrants the existence of a Soul, the originator or source of these attributes.

# 4. Introduction to Plato's Phaedo; Arguments for the existence of the soul, Part II
After a brief introduction to Plato's Phaedo, more arguments are offered in this lecture in defence of the existence of an immaterial soul. The emphasis here is on the fact that we need to believe in the existence of a soul in order to explain the claim that we possess free will. This is an argument dualists use as an objection to the physicalists: since no merely physical entity could have free will, there must be more to us than just being a physical object. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGXYeV2v5fU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=4&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Introduction to Plato's Phaedo 
	- Plato's literary style:
		- Discourses and dialogues in the form of plays to present philosophical arguments.
		- Interesting usage of Socrates as the primary character imbibing Plato's opinions rather than his teachers.
- [08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGXYeV2v5fU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=4&t=507s) - Chapter 2. Creativity and Reason in Machines 
	- Machines are programmed in the perspectives of the programmer.
		- Includes the biases and generalized reasoning strategies.

	- [[M Minsky - The Emotion Machine]]
	- Are machines incapable of comprehending emotions or have we not the abilities currently to "teach" emotions to machines?
- [20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGXYeV2v5fU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=4&t=1234s) - Chapter 4. "Qualia" in Emotion and Consciousness: The Dualist's Defence and Its Weakness 
	- Could someone blind "know" what it's like to see if one has been exposed to the knowledge of the cause and effect regarding the act of seeing?
	- We are currently unable to explain consciousness or the ability to define qualitative experiences, but that does not prove the impossibility of such a task.
	- Can the qualitative experience justify the existence of the Soul?
	- If at least one side of an argument cannot be explained, that is not reason enough to pick a side of the argument as the de facto standard. 
- [42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGXYeV2v5fU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=4&t=2540s) - Chapter 5. Free Will as a Defence of the Soul and Conclusion
	- A machine can be programmed to achieve that which its programmer can never achieve. Yet the machine is limited by its programming.
	- On the other hand, humans possess free will because we are not programmed, but this statement has no proof either.

# 5. Arguments for the existence of the soul, Part III: Free will and near-death experiences
Professor Kagan discusses in detail the argument of free will as proof for the existence of an immaterial soul. The argument consists of three premises: 1) We have free will. 2) Nothing subject to determinism has free will. 3) All purely physical systems are subject to determinism. The conclusion drawn from this is that humans are not a purely physical system; but Professor Kagan explains why this argument is not truly compelling. In addition, near-death experiences and the Cartesian argument are discussed at length. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWVlorPM3rA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=5&t=0s) - Chapter 1. The Dualist's Stance on Free Will and the Soul's Existence
	- Are we just extraordinary robots with a very sophisticated programming that render us subjects to determinism.
- [04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWVlorPM3rA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=5&t=297s) - Chapter 2. Determinism and Free Will Cannot Coexist -- Inspecting Incompatibility 
	- Quantum Mechanics defines the fundamental laws of Physics as not strictly deterministic. Radioactivite decay, for example, are probabilistic.
	- Incompatibility is not a compelling argument.
- [15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWVlorPM3rA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=5&t=922s) - Chapter 3. Positing the Soul's Existence for Near-Death Experiences 
	- Why are many near-death experiences so similar? Could cultural influences and existing stories play a role?
	- The individual has not really been dead. Unusual, hallucinatory experiences may just be a by-product of neuronal activities that may continue for a short while during which time the heartbeat has stopped and revived momentarily.
	- Is there a Soul leaving the body or is the body going through undue stress that can explain the. experience?

	- Most likely explanations involve illusions or trickery.

	- Can imagining the non-existence of one's body be possible if the body didn't exist?
- [45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWVlorPM3rA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=5&t=2734s) - Chapter 6. Conclusion
	- If A exists and B does not, then A and B must be logically separate entities. If they were not separate, then A cannot both exist and not exist (B = A)

# 6. Arguments for the existence of the soul, Part IV; Plato, Part I
The lecture begins with a continued discussion of the Cartesian argument and its weaknesses. The lecture then turns to Plato's metaphysical views in the context of his work, Phaedo. The key point in the discussion is the idea that in addition to the ordinary empirical world that we are familiar with, we posit the existence of a second realm in which the Platonic forms exist. These forms are the abstract properties that we attribute to physical objects, such as beauty, justice, goodness and so on. Since it is the soul that conceives of these Platonic forms and ideas, Plato argues that the soul not only outlives the body but lasts forever. It is perfect, immaterial and indestructible. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6_J79ZsXko&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=6&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Summary of the Cartesian Argument 
	- If the mind and the body are the same, then the mind without the body is like stating that the body is without the body. This does not make sense.
	- Can the smile of the Cheshire Cat in *Alice in Wonderland* exist without also imagining the cat's body parts that comprise the smile?
- [04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6_J79ZsXko&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=6&t=297s) - Chapter 2. Refuting the Cartesian Argument: The Morning and Evening Stars 
	- A disconnect between what is being perceived versus what actually is reality.
	- It may be possible that an environment exists where the mind and body are separate and this reality has only one physical form, and vice versa.
	- The Cartesian Argument has its limitations and may not be applicable in establishing a proof for the existence of a Soul separate from the Body.
- [19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6_J79ZsXko&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=6&t=1165s) - Chapter 3. Platonic Forms and the Immortality of the Soul 
	- As a Dualist, Plato questions the immortality of the Soul.
	- Platonic Forms: the ideals like Justice or Beauty.
		- The real world may share some likeness to forms but is not actual representation of them.
		- The domain of the Soul is that which cannot be seen in the empirical World.  
		- In a sense, the Soul is free from bodily distractions like pain and injustice.
- [31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6_J79ZsXko&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=6&t=1887s) - Chapter 4. Conclusion
	- Mathematics, for example, is full of abstract, intangible, ideas that the mind can grasp but does not exist in the real world that can be seen or felt.
	- Similarly, the mind or the Soul must be independent of the body and therefore, immortal.

# 7. Plato, Part II: Arguments for the immortality of the soul
The discussion of Plato's Phaedo continues, presenting more arguments for the existence and immortality of the soul. One such argument is "the argument from the nature of the forms," which states that because the forms are non-physical objects and cannot be grasped by something physical like the body, it follows that they must be grasped by the soul which must be non-physical as well. This argument is followed by the "argument from recycling" and "the argument from recollection." 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_ES5Y6qchA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=7&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Review of Plato's Heaven: Platonic Forms 
	- Platonic Forms are unchanging and everlasting.
		- Justice and Beauty are not ideals that are changing.
	- The Soul is able to grasp these Forms.
- [04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_ES5Y6qchA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=7&t=253s) - Chapter 2. Concerns and Issues Leading to the Development of Platonic Forms 
	- Though a house's occupant is separate from the house, if the house is destroyed while occupied, the occupant is also destroyed.
	- The purpose of a philosopher is to experiment with and justify certain thought processes in order to come up with concrete arguments.
	- Even if Dualism holds, since it is not proven that the Soul is immortal, the philosopher attempts to distance mental activities as much from the physical without attempting to completely eliminate the physical.
- [14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_ES5Y6qchA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=7&t=857s) - Chapter 3. The Argument from the Nature of the Forms 
	- From the Platonic Metaphysics:
		1. Ideas and forms are eternal and non-physical.
		2. Eternal and non-physical can only be grasped by the eternal and non-physical.
			- "The impure cannot grasp the pure" is the premise here.
			- This is a weak argument as it does not follow that it takes one to know one. Though, this particular case may still be applicable.
		3. Thus, eternal (immortal) and non-physical (not the body).
- [24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_ES5Y6qchA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=7&t=1473s) - Chapter 4. The Argument from Recycling 
	- The argument that an object like a car comprises of parts that will continue to exist even after the car itself is dead.
	- But this does not imply every part continues to exist. 
	- So, a Soul, if a part of the Body, may or may not be immortal.
- [33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_ES5Y6qchA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=7&t=2013s) - Chapter 5. The Argument from Recollection 
	- A photograph of someone may surface their memories but should not be confused with the actual being of their self. 
		- For the memory recollection, one must have collected the memory as a prerequisite.
	- Perfection is an Ideal. It is not of this World.
	- To grasp the concept of a Soul, then it must have existed as an Ideal prior to the conception of the Body.
- [43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_ES5Y6qchA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=7&t=2634s) - Chapter 6. Do Plato's Arguments Suffice?
	- Is the acquisition of prior knowledge necessary as opposed to extrapolating Platonic forms from newfound experiences.

# 8. Plato, Part III: Arguments for the immortality of the soul (cont.)
The lecture focuses exclusively on one argument for the immortality of the soul from Plato's Phaedo, namely, "the argument from simplicity." Plato suggests that in order for something to be destroyed, it must have parts, that is, it must be possible to "take it apart." Arguing that the soul is simple, that it does not have parts, Plato believes that it would logically follow that the soul is indestructible. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJzGgp-hoKc&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=8&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Frailties in "Recycling" and "Recollecting" Arguments 
	- Recollection: the Soul's existence before conception does not entail the Soul's continued existence after the body's death.
	- Recycling: If the parts existed before and continue to do so after, then immortality has been established.
		- A tyre is a part of the car, it existed prior to the building of a car, 
		- it may exist long after a car is dismantled, 
		- eventually, the decaying of the tyre is still inevitable.
	- What is needed is an argument or evidence against the decomposition of the Soul.
- [09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJzGgp-hoKc&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=8&t=561s) - Chapter 2. The Argument from Simplicity 
	- Objects are composed of parts, thus objects may be decomposed.
	- Platonic Forms, on the other hand, are eternal, invisible, and indestructible, since they are simple.
	- Prime Numbers cannot be decomposed into parts, except by One and Itself.
- [19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJzGgp-hoKc&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=8&t=1141s) - Chapter 3. Does Indestructibility and Invisibility of the Soul Necessarily Mean Immortality? Objections from Cebes and Simmias 
	- If the Soul is Invisible, is it Indestructible?
		- But Harmony can be destroyed - Simmias
			- Harmony is Invisible.
		- Is the Soul comparable to Harmony?
	- If the Soul is Indestructible, is it also Immortal?
- [30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJzGgp-hoKc&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=8&t=1836s) - Chapter 4. Harmony as a Counter Analogy 
	- Possible definitions for Invisible Objects, or what Plato may have meant:
		1. Can't be seen.
		2. Can't be observed (5 senses).
		3. Can't be detected.
	- Since Harmony can be sensed, it is not Invisible.
	- On the other hand, the Soul is indeed Invisible by all three definitions.
- [42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJzGgp-hoKc&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=8&t=2556s) - Chapter 5. Radio Waves - To Detect Rather Than to Sense the Soul
	- Plato obviously was not aware of such phenomena during his times.
	- Are Souls comparable to:
		- Platonic Forms (Invisible and Indestructible).
		- Radio Waves (Invisible but destructible).
	- Souls can be detected by its effect on the body. 
		- The Soul is therefore visible.

# 9. Plato, Part IV: Arguments for the immortality of the soul (cont.)
Professor Kagan elaborates on the "argument from simplicity" and discusses in detail Plato's claims that the soul is simple, changeless and therefore indestructible. The final Platonic argument under discussion is the "argument from essential properties" in which the essential properties of the soul are addressed. At the end of the lecture the question of whether one needs to argue for physicalism is posed. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=borZuyV0uk8&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=9&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Assumptions Made in the Argument from Simplicity 
	- Souls change, in their outlook, viewpoints, etc,.
	- Even if the Soul is Simple, this does not imply Immortality.
- [05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=borZuyV0uk8&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=9&t=356s) - Chapter 2. Plato's Defense against the Harmony Analogy 
	- Like a musical instrument is capable of producing Harmony, the body is capable of producing the Soul.
		- This shows the dependence of the Soul's existence on the Body.
	- There can be degrees of Harmony. Is there degrees of Soul?
		- Varying degrees of mental activity is still possible.
	- Under Physicalism, does the Body produce the Mind, like the Harp producing Harmony?
- [19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=borZuyV0uk8&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=9&t=1182s) - Chapter 3. Essential and Contingent Properties and the Argument from Essential Properties
	- Contingent: A car that is red could have been blue.
	- Essential: A fire that is hot could never have been cold.
	- Plato claims that the Soul has the essential property of being alive.
		- Being alive means being capable of reasoning and thinking.
		- Being essentially alive implies that the Soul is deathless.
		- Hence, the Soul is Indestructible.
	- Interpreting the claim that something is deathless:
		- Can't exist and be dead.
		- Already dead or never alive. What is dead may never die.
			- Thus, being alive may not imply being deathless.
- [37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=borZuyV0uk8&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=9&t=2226s) - Chapter 4. Kagan: "There is No Good Reason to Believe in Souls" 
	- The arguments pro-Dualism aren't very convincing. 
	- If there is no proof for the existence of Souls, can there be a proof for the non-existence of Souls?
	- One does need to proof the non-existence of something, only disprove all arguments for the existence of something.
- [47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=borZuyV0uk8&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=9&t=2873s) - Chapter 5. Qualifications and Conclusion
	- Physicalism is a more compelling position to side with.

# 10. Personal identity, Part I: Identity across space and time and the soul theory
The lecture focuses on the question of the metaphysical key to personal identity. What does it mean for a person that presently exists to be the very same person in the future? The first approach to answering this question is the "soul theory," that is, the key to being the same person is having the same soul. Difficulties with that approach are then discussed, independent of the question whether souls exist or not. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00KDsArsQ3A&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=10&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Introduction 
	- Explore some arguments for individuals being restricted to a body.

	- Who was that someone who went to bed yesterday in comparison to the one who woke up in the same bed today. Who will wake up in the same bed that one sleeps in tonight?
	- The body regenerates and replaces a majority of its cellular composition in approximately seven years.
- [14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00KDsArsQ3A&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=10&t=844s) - Chapter 3. The Aging of a Car and Space-Time Worms 
	- A particular car throughout the course of its depreciable lifespan cannot be anything but that particular car. This does not mean that a particular stage of the car is the same as a different particular stage of the car.
	- What about permutations of Lego blocks? The Lego block set may remain the same throughout, yet the rearrangements are unique creations that may or may not exist at a particular point in time.
	- Space-Time Worms here, represent the lifetime of a particular object. The Worms may consist of multiple stages that differ from each other.
	- Suppose an object gets replaced, one part at a time, until, pretty much every part has been replaced. How does the object at a latter stage compare a former stage?

	- A Space-Time Worm may help represent and differentiate one identity from another.
	- What's the key to preserving one's identity along a timeline?
		- The possible theory of a Soul serving as that metaphysical Glue.
		- DNA or fingerprints? Definitely true, for the physical body.
- [46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00KDsArsQ3A&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=10&t=2788s) - Chapter 5. Is the Soul Truly the Key to Personal Identity?
	- Assuming dualism holds, what if Souls get swapped? Would this still remain a good solution for a key to one's identity?

# 11. Personal identity, Part II: The body theory and the personality theory
Two more views regarding the metaphysical key to personal identity are discussed: the body view and the personality view. According to the body view, an individual is identified in terms of his or her physical body. According to the personality view, an individual is identified by his or her unique set of beliefs, desires, memories, goals, and so on.

	- One is reminded of the plot from *The Prestige*.
	- Does the personal identity remain unchanged despite changes in atomic composition? 
		- How about cases of dramatic changes, like drastic weight loss or an accident involving a loss of a limb? Still the same identity although the outlook of the individual may change or society's perception of the individual changes.
	- That one part of the brain that handles the information on its identity may be a better key. Similar to an SSN or passport.

# 12. Personal identity, Part III: Objections to the personality theory
The lecture focuses on the problems directly related to the personality theory as key to personal identity. The theory states that a person retains his or her individuality so long as he or she has the same ongoing personality. The main objection raised to this claim is the problem of duplication. The lecture explores cases in which the same personality has been transferred or exported to multiple bodies.

	- Which perspective would the Ego use to make decisions that maximize its utility and lifespan?
	- Who's Linda? And how does the Mad Scientist know whom to offer the generous choice?
	- The personality perceives the pain from the torture, hence this has to be the Key to Personal Identity, irrespective of which body the personality inhabits.
		- The inhabitant and house analogy can be used here as well.

# 13. Personal identity, Part IV; What matters?
The personality theory is revised to state that the key to personal identity is having the same personality provided that there is no branching, that is, provided there is no transfer or duplication of the same personality from one body to another. Similar "no branching" requirements are added to the other theories as well. At the end of class, Professor Kagan suggests a shift from thinking about the survival of the soul in terms of "what does it take to survive?" to "what is it that matters in survival?".

	- What does it matter if the experiences and memories are not transferred between lives or duplications or clones? After all, aren't the experiences, the memories, the stories, and the values we have acquired over our lifetimes, what we consider aspects that comprise much of our identity?
	- What's wrong with a fresh start? Why is there a need to preserve all that one has accumulated? Why is there a pressing need to retain control of one's possessions?

	- What are we really prioritizing when we discuss the immortality of our Soul?
	- What aspects are we really seeking to preserve and transcend our deaths?

# 14. What matters (cont.); The nature of death, Part I
The suggestion is made that what matters in survival is the future existence of someone with a personality similar to one's own. Professor Kagan then turns to the question, "what is it to die?". In answering this question, attention is first drawn to the bodily and mental functions that are crucial in defining the moment of death.

	- Mere survival is not satisfying. Given the choice, One wishes to thrive.
	- It is important that one not only is able to continue living consciously despite one's bodily death.
	- Or survival is not of importance, but instead keeping the personality intact is.

	- The personality is lost upon the time of death?
	- Which set of functions act as clear determiners of the occurrence of death?
		- The bodily or personality functions?
	- When does someone cease to function?
		- Or does a corpse continue to function?
		- Does the fetus function under the personality theory?

	- Under the body view, the fetus and the vegetable are both alive.
		- Being a person is only a phase of the journey of life.
	- Under the person view, only a fully functioning person is alive.
		- Cartesian logic may rule out the aliveness of many bodies.
- [30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_vqoz05W-0&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=14&t=1826s) - Chapter 4. When Does Personality Begin or Cease to Exist? 
	- A contradiction arises if the body is alive but the personality is not. 
		- Some distinction is needed to differentiate the death of one but not both.
	- If identity is derived from a personality occurring in the brain, then at what point can we say that a personality begins to exist. 
	- Two particularly hot topics that present the ambiguity of this dillema:
		- Abortion: the fetus is heavily dependent on the mother for all bodily functions.
		- Life-Support: the patient is heavily dependent on artificial means for survival.

	- What are human Laws designed for? Prioritizing one over the other may entail that the lines drawn may shift drastically.
	- Sleeping without much brain activity may mean being dead under the personality theory. So one could get away with destroying a sleeping body because one cannot murder a dead body.

# 15. The nature of death (cont.); Believing you will die
The lecture explores the question of the state of being dead. Even though the most logical claim seems to be that when a person stops P-functioning he or she is dead, a more careful consideration must allow for exceptions, such as when one is asleep or in a coma. Professor Kagan then suggests that on some level nobody believes that he or she is going to die. As a case in point, he takes Tolstoy's famous character Ivan Ilych.

	- Syllogism - All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Thus, Socrates is mortal.
	- [[L Tolstoy - The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]
		- The protagonist is genuinely surprised at his mortality.
		- Maybe one understands something about mortality without really understanding the gravity of the situation one finds oneself in.

# 16. Dying alone; The badness of death, Part I
Professor Kagan puts forward the claim that Tolstoy's character Ivan Ilych is quite the typical man in terms of his views on mortality. All of his life he has known that death is imminent but has never really believed it. When he suddenly falls ill and is about to die, the fact of his mortality shocks him. In trying to further access how people think about death, Professor Kagan explores the claim that "we all die alone," presents a variety of arguments against it and ends by considering whether the primary badness of death could lie in the effects on those who are left behind.

	- Public assassinations and executions prove this statement false on a literal sense. 
	- Battlefields involve brothers dying in each others arms.
	- Dying in joint conjunction.
		 - Romeo and Juliet
		 - Mass suicides under cult practices.
	- "We are all in this together!"
		- Similar to the glass half full/empty analogy, we could see ourselves as living/dying and both perspectives are true.
		- Wouldn't this also entail that we are all living alone as well? Since each one of us is experiencing the act of living only by themself.

	- Analogous to feelings of loneliness, the inability to connect with the "living" as one approaches one's final hours. Dying alone, here then, describes the alienation of the dying from the living.
	- Each interpretation of the statement seems to only apply to a certain subset of the population, under rather specific circumstances.

	- Moving on from the metaphysical aspect of Death, we discuss the ethical and utilitarian aspects of Death.
	- What does the concept of Death imply about Life? 
	- Why do we view as Death bad?
		- It is not bad for the Dead, just the living left behind with the loss.
		- So, the externalities associated with Death attach an overall negative utility value to Death itself.
	- How is it, that Death is bad for the dead?

# 17. The badness of death, Part II: The deprivation account
This lecture continues to explore the issue of why death may be bad. According to the deprivation account, what is bad about death is the fact that because one ceases to exist, one becomes deprived of the good things in life. Being dead is not intrinsically bad; it is comparatively bad and one is worse off only by virtue of not being able to enjoy the things one enjoyed while alive, such as watching the sunset, listening to music, and discussing philosophy. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7knGxL5DaU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=17&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Introduction: The Central Badness of Death 
	- The emotions and feelings triggered by death, such as anxiety and fear, are negative by nature. Similarly, the loss and effectations of the dead on those living are a negative externality. How then can we infer that Death itself is bad?
- [04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7knGxL5DaU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=17&t=275s) - Chapter 2. The Deprivation Account of Badness in Death 
	- To claim the badness of something, one must have the ability to experience the badness. To claim something is hot, one must be able to feal the heat.
	- If death is not intrinsically bad, then it may be relatively bad.
		- The opportunity cost of non-existence may be the ability to keep on living and continue experiencing.
	- Non-existence has no attributes that are itself of inconvenience. Only in comparison with Life, is Death a worse option.
		- One ceases to experience all that Life has to offer. 
		- Thus, someone dead has been deprived of Life. 
- [13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7knGxL5DaU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=17&t=802s) - Chapter 3. Epicurus: "When Does Death Become Bad?" 
	- Death is the absence of Life.
	- Is it possible to claim that Death is Bad at a certain maturation period?
		- According to the deprication theory, death is bad when one is no longer alive to experience life.
- [21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7knGxL5DaU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=17&t=1281s) - Chapter 4. The Existence Requirement: Is It Necessary? 
	- Shouldn't one exist to experience the badness of a situation?
	- The dead do not exist.
	- Thus, Death cannot be bad.
	- Can non-existence be bad for someone that never actually existed?
		- Assuming the existence requirement holds, there is no reason to claim that a non-existent individual that never existed has been deprived of Life.
		- On the other hand, must we feel sorry for those that never existed?
- [32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7knGxL5DaU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=17&t=1968s) - Chapter 5. Should Death Be Bad for the Loss of the Unborn Person? 
	- Why should one waste time over what could have been, the possibilities that never became realities?
		- There are infinitely many permutations that comprise of the universal set of all that could have been real.
	- **Is the Universal Set being deprived of all that could have been?**
		- Does the Universal Set deserve our sympathies?
		- Shouldn't the Set be capable of experiencing such a deprivation then?
			- If it is incapable, then does the Set exist?
			- If it is non-existent, then who or what is truly being deprived?
	- The Existence Requirement states that something is bad for Oneself, only if one exists:
		- at some point in time (the modest claim).
		- at the same time as the thing in reference (the bold claim).
- [49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7knGxL5DaU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=17&t=2981s) - Chapter 6. Conclusion
	- The bold claim
		- Death is not bad as someone dead does not exist at the same time.
		- Is Death bad for someone non-existent who does not exist at the same time? 
	- The modest claim 
		- Death may be bad for someone who existed at some point and/or is dead.
		- Does not claim that Non-existence is bad for someone non-existent.

# 18. The badness of death, Part III; Immortality, Part I
The discussion of the badness of death continues by asking whether it is bad that we do not exist before our birth. The views of a number of contemporary philosophers, such as Tom Nagle, Fred Feldman, and Derek Parfit, are introduced. Then Professor Kagan turns to the subject of immortality. Would it be desirable to live forever, and if so, under what circumstances one might enjoy such a prolonged existence? The lecture concludes with Bernard Williams' take on immortality which posits that no kind of human life can continue to be enjoyable and attractive for eternity. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzuVMZM4TyI&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=18&t=0s) - Chapter 1. The Modest Existence Clause 
	- Without an Existence requirement, one could claim that non-existence is bad for the non-existent.
	- The shorter the lifespan, the worse it gets.
		- As the limit approaches zero, it gets worse and worse.
	- Under the modest claim, we transcend the limitations of the borderline cases.
		- But if the lifespan equals zero, it was not bad.
		- To have never existed is better than being born in the first place.

	- Two periods of non-existence, one before birth, and one after death.
		- Equivalent yet asymmetric in nature.
		- Post-death involves loss and Pre-birth involves possibility.
	- Why is losing something we once possessed a priority in comparison to losing something we were never able to possess?
		- Loss-Averseness?

	- Being born earlier does not entail a longer lifespan.
		- Might just shift the overall timeline.
	- Non-existence after life and the postponing of death involves thinking actively about a longer lifespan.
	- Under the deprivation account, a shorter lifespan is clearly worse than a longer lifespan.
	- We approach the past, the present, and the future, with completely asymmetrical attitudes.
		- It is not obvious that this attitude is actually a rational behavior.
- [33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzuVMZM4TyI&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=18&t=2025s) - Chapter 4. Is Immortality the Antidote to Deprivation-Based Death?
	- We remain unsatisfied with whatever lifespan we are endowed with because we are consistently deprived of a longer lifespan.
	- Death is bad under the deprivation account, if and only if there exists positive utility to be continually derived from Life.
	- Marginal Utility may be applied to Life itself.
	- Immortality of life without the immortality of the quality of life, such as health, wealth, and general well-being, is indeed worse than dying at some point.
		- Death would in fact be a blessing, if it provides the escape from Life's drudgeries.
	- What kind of lifestyle could one describe and imagine, where one would not mind living in perpetuity? 
	- If the alternative to Death is Immortality, and we have considered the badness of Immortality, then Death may not be all that bad.
		- Now, it may still be a bad thing to die sooner than later.

	- Immortality may not be the most desirable of wishes upon closer inspection.

# 19. Immortality Part II; The value of life, Part I
The lecture begins with further exploration of the question of whether it is desirable to live forever under the right circumstances, and then turns to consideration of some alternative theories of the nature of well-being. What makes a life worth living? One popular theory is hedonism, but the thought experiment of being on an "experience machine" suggests that this view may be inadequate.

	- Wishes for Immortality may just be a clichéd hyperbole.
	- At a certain point a lifetime of pleasure will also become routine, and pain and drudgery may suddenly become actively sought after.
		- “**Life swings like a pendulum backward and forward between pain and boredom**.” - A Schopenhauer.
	- Surgeries, like lobotomies, could turn humans into more animal-like beings in order to cope with the boredom from immortality.
		- But this suggests reducing a human to something lesser.

	- The problem is boredom and routinization, not Immortality.
	- To keep boredom at bay, memory wipes or drastic personality changes can be introduced. But this may imply that a person today may no longer Be the same person tomorrow.
- [19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vj0LdtAaZA&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=19&t=1150s) - Chapter 3. What Makes a Good Life Good? 
	- Living just long enough to maximize satisfaction may be preferable to Immortality. Dying too soon is what we conventionally consider bad.

# 20. The value of life, Part II; Other bad aspects of death, Part I
Lecture 20 continues the discussion of the value of life. It considers the neutral container theory, which holds that the value of life is simply a function of its contents, both pleasant and painful, and contrasts this with the valuable container theory, which assigns value to being alive itself. The lecture then turns to a consideration of some of the other aspects of death that may contribute to the badness of death. Among the issues addressed are the inevitability, variability and unpredictability of death.

	- Hedonism may be wrong if the EM with a curated set of tapes is still missing something.
	- Simulated experience of eating a cake is not the same as actually eating a cake.
		- What if the machine could be tweaked to make it feel more real?

	- The pitfalls of generalizing a value metric.
		- Optimism vs Pessimism: Net Positive or Net Negative.
	- Judging Life's value by its contents vs as the container of contents.
	- Container Theory: Life has the capability of containing valuable contents, and the container itself has value. 
		- In other words, life itself is of value since it may contain other objects of value.
		- Prioritizing the value of being as opposed to doing or having.
		- Provides weightage to existing, even if the existing occurs in poverty, sickness, or torture.

	- Modest claim: Being may have intrinsic value, yet it can be outweighed by negatives.
		- There may be occasions where death is a rational choice.
	- Bold claim: Being has so much value that no amount of having or doing may reduce the net value to a negative.
		- Staying alive at all costs.
	- The moderate view: death comes sooner for some depriving them of the change to maximize utility, whereas for others, death comes too late where they have maximized utility and are now experiencing their decline.

	- Deprivation of maximizing one's utility out of their life.

		- There is absolutely no course of actions that can prevent Death, though one can postpone the inevitable.
	- F Dostoevsky - Notes from Underground

	- Would it make sense to introduce an exact date and time of death, as well as the means of getting there?
	- What of disparities in lifespan?
		- Being short hurts more than having more helps more.
	- Gene mapping can increase predictability of lifespan.
	- The unpredictability can be a major trigger for anxious thoughts.
		- The average lifespan may not be an indicator that one would escape a car accident tomorrow.
		- The insurance industry exploits this very fear.

	- People prefer the "rags to riches" narrative over the reverse.
		- Both have equal contents, though the order is different.
		- The future is more important than the past. This forces people to prioritize seeking the former narrative.
	- Who does not wish to take the reigns on writing and directing their own narrative?

# 21. Other bad aspects of death, Part II
Further bad aspects of death are considered, including ubiquity, or the fact that death may occur at any time and strike anyone. Professor Kagan invites students to contemplate the possibility of death-free time periods, vacation spots, and activities. Then there is consideration of the value of the human condition, which consists of life, followed by death. Finally, the question is raised as to whether it could be appropriate to refuse to face the facts about our mortality. Professor Kagan distinguishes between two ways in which thinking about these could influence human behavior. On the one hand, it may give one the reason to behave differently; on the other hand, it may just cause a change in behavior.

	- Knowing this helps us really plan out and maximize the returns on each and every iota of time available. 
	- The shortness of time may become extremely relevant upon the diagnosis of a terminal disorder. 
		- What would we really prioritize? How would we evaluate our life's path and change trajectories?

	- Death could strike an individual anytime and anywhere.
	- There is no option to prevent the improbable events. Improbable is not the same as Impossible.
	- Imagine One had the option of being immune from Death, even on a temporary basis? Or being immune by engaging in certain activities.
		- Or the option of being immortal with the option of dying as a valid choice.
		- On the contrary, there are cases of individuals seeking death. Adrenaline junkies. Thrillseakers. Biting the dog that bit someone.

	- Death only occurs after some living has occured, even if momentarily.
	- Their combined value may not be equal to the sum of their isolated parts. Synergy, but maybe in reverse?
	- The finiteness of our time could promote our time to the status of a luxury commodity. 
	- Eventually, each one of us, being returned to dust, may not be a consolation for the possibly extraordinary lives we lived.

	- The inevitability of Death outweighs everything Life has to offer. A pessimistic outlook that clouds all of one's Life.
		- Is suicide the rational approach? It does not solve anything, besides escaping from the very problem.
	- Is it better to be able to taste some life even if Death is inevitable?

	- Should we just admit and accept the facts and move on with life? 
		- Or can we remain ignorant of the facts?
	- Not knowing the laws of gravity does not imply that we are not immune to it.
	- Ignorance is bliss. How could ignoring facts about our very lives help us? Denying the truth from our selves is not ideal even if the impact may not all that pleasant.
	- Are some facts merely causing a change in behavior or providing a reason to change one's behavior. Disregarding the facts in the case of the former is a valid response.
- [47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qrx6x3izQw&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=21&t=2846s) - Chapter 6. Controlling the Impact of Thinking about Death and Conclusion
	- There are appropriate times and places for discussing the facts related to our  mortality.

# 22. Fear of death
Professor Kagan explores the issue of how thinking about death may influence the way we live. Fear as an emotional response to death is discussed as well as whether it is appropriate and under what conditions. A distinction is made between fear of the process of dying, and fear of death itself and what may come when one is dead. Finally, a number of other negative emotions are considered as possible appropriate responses to death and dying, such as anger, sadness, and sorrow. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lF-uMIfL6s&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=22&t=0s) - Chapter 1. How Should Thinking about Death Influence Behavior? 
	- How should we go about discussing our mortality in an appropriate manner.
		- And what is the appropriate response to such discussions?
- [02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lF-uMIfL6s&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=22&t=134s) - Chapter 2. Is Fear of Death a Rational Appropriate Response? 
	- What emotions are considered appropriate when discussing our mortality?
	- There may be a set of appropriate conditions that warrant the Fear of Death at a particular point of time and place for it to be considered a rational and appropriate response.
- [08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lF-uMIfL6s&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=22&t=520s) - Chapter 3. Required Conditions for Feeling Fear of Death 
	- The object that someone is afraid of, must be a bad object.
		- The object in question must be capable of striking fear.
	- A noticeable probability of being negatively affected by the object in question.
		- Fear of highly improbable events will be considered inappropriate.
	- A level of uncertainty must be associated with the fear.
		- If an event is certain, then anger or other emotions may seem more appropriate.
- [22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lF-uMIfL6s&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=22&t=1326s) - Chapter 4. What Is Meant by Fear? How Much of This Fear Is Appropriate? 
	- Maybe the process of dying is unimaginably painful and strike fear in this manner of speaking.
		- Fear of a painful dying may then be appropriate.
		- Painkillers, if adequetely administered, may alleviate or even eradicate this fear.
	- The fear of Death itself does not seem rational.
		- We do not know if Death itself is bad.
		- The probability of death affecting us is certainty.
	- The fear of death because one might end up in Hell based on one's religious views itself is not irrational, though the irrationality of one's religious views is a different topic of debate.
	- A healthy level of fear in response to the unpredictable nature of death makes sense. There is absolutely no means to prepare for the very moment Death strikes, even if it can be estimated to some extent.
- [34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lF-uMIfL6s&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=22&t=2069s) - Chapter 5. Anger as Another Emotional Reaction to Death 
	- Death can spare us the boredom stemming from an immortal life.
	- If fear is not appropriate, is anger a viable alternative?
		- Anger over not having enough time to live.
		- Anger may not always be a rational reaction either.
	- Anger needs some object to direct the emotion to, but often times if it is directed to an inanimate object like the Universe, then even this is not rational.
- [44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lF-uMIfL6s&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=22&t=2689s) - Chapter 6. Sorrow and Preciousness: Other Emotions on Death and Conclusion
	- The five stages of grief:
		- Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
	- Sorrow or sadness for what?
	- K Vonnegut - Cat's Cradle: "sitting-up mud".
	- Bitterness of being alive? We should consider how lucky we are to even be of an animated nature and be conscious of our nature.
		- Thus, expressing gratitude should be the rational approach.

# 23. How to live given the certainty of death
In this lecture, Professor Kagan invites students to pose the question of how one should live life knowing that it will certainly end in death. He also explores the issue of how we should set our goals and how we should go about achieving them, bearing in mind the time constraints. Other questions raised are how this ultimately affects the quality of our work and our accomplishments, as well as how we decide what is worth doing in life. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8Hu465KL1w&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=23&t=0s) - Chapter 1. How Carefully Should We Live? 
	- The luck of beign alive in the first place.
	- If this is our one life, how should we go about ensuring we can maximize our lifespan as well as utility of our life?
	- How should we be living if we were immortal?
		- Even with unlimited time to repeat a process, our approach could get stuck in the wrong pattern.
	- The shortness of our lives dictate the need for us to be careful.
		- Every action and moment has to count.
		- Limited resources must be allocated efficiently.

	- Being alive may just be enough but what activities we choose to enrich our lives should also matter.
	- Strategize on prioritizing those activities that matter.
		- Be realistic. Set small goals that can be achieved for sure.
		- Be ambitious. Set broader goals that may be worth accomplishing even if one doesn't succeed. 
		- Diversify among small and large goals in order to balance one's life out.

	- Some achieve more in the short time they have been blessed with while others live up to a ripe old age as bitter individuals.
	- The quantity and quality matter in combination. 
	- "Less is More" - Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
		- Deiter Rams and his design philosophy.
	- "Once I've lived like the Gods, more is not needed." - Holderlin
	- For most people, quality can indeed compensate for quantity.
		- This can be pushed to the extreme. If one sets up a lofty goal and achieves it in a short time, that is superior to a long life dull of accomplishments.

	- "I don't want to be immortal through my work, I want to be immortal through not dying." - Woody Allen
	- Atoms being recycled after one's death. From the Laws of Conservation, our deaths shouldn't mean much.
		- Only the parts will "live on". But the Whole has disintegrated.
	- Accomplishments achieving some form of pseudo-immortality. A means to establish one's mark on the universe or at least among the living.
		- The works thus surviving the death of the creator.
	- Schopenhauer and his thoughts on dust. His opinion of deluding himself with "accomplishments".

	- The assumption that Life is what is worth having and Death, depriving us of Life, is what makes Death bad.
	- On the contrary, what if we hold the opinion that Life itself is not that great?
	- Buddhism offers a solution on minimizing the Loss by removing the attachment to Life itself.

# 24. Suicide, Part I: The rationality of suicide
This is the first of a series of lectures on suicide. Two very distinct contexts are presented in which the subject can be further explored. The first is rationality and the question of under what circumstances it makes sense to end one's own life. The second is morality and the question of whether we can ever ethically justify resorting to suicide. The lecture's focus is on the rational requirements of suicide, and Professor Kagan introduces a number of cases which demonstrate that ending one's life, in certain instances, may be rationally sound. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MajfZIyHP8U&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=24&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Introduction to Suicide: Does it Make Sense? Distinguishing Issues of Rationality and Morality
	- Strong reactions from society on suicide creates the need to separate discussions on suicide's rationality vs morality.
- [05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MajfZIyHP8U&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=24&t=314s) - Chapter 2. When Is It Rational to Commit Suicide? Problems with the Two-State Requirement 
	- How can one trust one's reasons on attempting suicide?
		- Maybe the precursors to reaching one's judgement may be flawed.
		- How does one really come to the conclusion that removing oneself from the world would make the world better?
	- Comparing the two different states, one before and after the crucial decision allows one to better judge one's conclusions.
		- In case of a suicide, the second state is incomparable, as states require existence as a precondition.
		- Death is not a state.
		- This argument implies that Life's virtues are also incomparable.
- [17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MajfZIyHP8U&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=24&t=1031s) - Chapter 3. Is Life Worth Having in the First Place? An Exploration of Intrinsic Value 
	- Under hedonism, where net utility is measured, there may be cases where life is already of negative value and death may be a superior option.
	- Again, we have various theories that measure intrinsic value.
		- Each have their own ranges of values.
		- Each have their own flaws where borderline conditions fail.
	- Are there then rational frameworks that prove that life is worth not having or continuing? At least on a circumstantial basis where it makes sense?
		- Pessimism considers that life is intrinsically worthless.
		- Moderates consider the grey area.
		- The Fantastic view considers that all life is better than nothing.
- [28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MajfZIyHP8U&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=24&t=1731s) - Chapter 4. Medical Complications: Rationale for Euthanasia
	- A terminal patient is not doing anyone a favour by continuing to exist.
		- Except as a source of data for medical specialists.
	- Suppose, the quality of life is measured by a net positive or negative value per timeslice and the gradient of its change over time is tracked.
		- Going from a positive value to a less positive value does not warrant that death is better.
		- But there's a point where the quality goes from positive to a negative value where death may be justified.
- [37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MajfZIyHP8U&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=24&t=2255s) - Chapter 5. Suicide on a Positive-Negative Life Curve
	- The choice of ending one's life while one is capable of doing so. Even if this means foregoing a good amount of quality time because soon, one shall become incapable of attempting suicide.
	- A small dip in quality that may eventually revert its course, is not reason to attempt suicide on rational grounds.

# 25. Suicide, Part II: Deciding under uncertainty
The discussion of suicide continues. A few more cases are introduced to consider circumstances under which it might be rational to end one's life, and more graphs are drawn that show relevant variations in the quality of one's life. A question is then posed about how one should make a decision about continuing or ending life, given that one cannot know the future with certainty. Finally, two quick moral arguments concerning suicide which rest on theological premises are presented. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKbV8NcyCrk&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=25&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Is Suicide Itself Rational? A Time-Value Analysis 
	- At what point might suicide be a rational decision?
		- A diagnoses of a terminal illness with no cure, where the quality of life will regress with absolute certainty.
		- *Seppuku*, to preserve one's honor.
		- Suicide for political reasons. To preserve one's stance instead of bowing down to the will of the masses.
	- "To be or not to be, that is the question."
- [12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKbV8NcyCrk&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=25&t=778s) - Chapter 2. To Continue or End Life Given the Uncertainty of Death 
	- Without a crystal ball, there is no certainty about one's conclusions.
	- The possible exists, where the judgement for such a decision, may become clouded from the high stakes involved.
	- In case of poor health, suicide removes the chances of playing another round for the possibility of a recovery, though remote. 
		- This may be similar to playing the lottery. How are buying scratch card ever a rational decision?
- [25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKbV8NcyCrk&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=25&t=1530s) - Chapter 3. Rationalizing Suicide in Cases of Illness 
	- Condemned building commissioned for demolition.
	- What must be the necessary conditions for euthanasia?
	- Chances of the overly emotional situation being grounds for clouded judgement.
		- On the contrary, shouldn't requesting surgery with the potential of recovery also be subject to the same emotional biases?
- [36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKbV8NcyCrk&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=25&t=2200s) - Chapter 4. Introduction to the Morality of Suicide: Is Life a Gift?
	- Even under cases where suicide is rational, it may not be moral.
	- God's Will? Is this a justified reason to keep on living?
		- According to Hume, wouldn't it also be wrong to save a life since that would be against God's Will?
		- If it was God's Will that CPR was performed to save a life, wouldn't it also be God's Will to kill oneself?
		- Where's the instruction manual on Life? Holy texts are selectively followed and disregarded where one finds convenient.
	- Gratitude. The debt of gratitude must be repaid by continuing to live.
		- Life, being a Gift, must be something one must be grateful for.
		- Suppose, the Gift is being gifted under gunpoint, does one have a choice?

# 26. Suicide, Part III: The morality of suicide and course conclusion
The lecture begins by examining the consequences a suicide has on both the person committing it and those around this person. The question is raised, however, whether this factor is the only that counts morally, as utilitarians claim, or whether other factors matter morally as well, as deontologists claim. The moral relevance of a deontological prohibition against harming the innocent is considered. A concluding summary of the course is offered. 
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-IgKgTcHkU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=26&t=0s) - Chapter 1. Introduction: The Consequences of Suicide 
	- What makes an action morally acceptable or forbidden?
		- The measure of externalities on all stakeholders.
	- Assuming that suicide is rational, when is it also morally justifiable?
		- Judging by the consequences, what is the externality on the one attempting suicide, one's close relations, bystanders, and many others?
		- Suppose, benefit derived from the suicide is so strong that it outweighs the suffering of others?
- [08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-IgKgTcHkU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=26&t=505s) - Chapter 2. Utilitarianism on the Morality of Suicide 
	- Utilitarianism restricts the morality of an action by solely judging the consequences. 
	- More information available, more accurate the estimate on utility.
	- What of the utility to other stakeholders?
		- Wouldn't the government miss out on tax payments?
		- Wouldn't close relations suffer from the loss?
		- Wouldn't the hospital miss out on revenue?
- [13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-IgKgTcHkU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=26&t=801s) - Chapter 3. Deontology and Prohibition against Harming the Innocent 
	- Consequences cannot be the only thing. According to Deontologists, other things matter as well.
		- The means, for example, that result in the consequences, though the ends may be for the greater good.
	- Assuming there is a Right to Life, suicide involves the killing of an innocent, even if the killing is done by the Self.
		- Is there a different set of moralities when it comes to how one treats others and how one treats oneself?
	- How is suicide any different then, from the homicide of the Self?
		- Could this be an act of Self-defense? Acting in a manner that is rational in order to prevent a worser outcome if kept alive.
		- Is an amputation to prevent the spread of an infection a violation?
- [28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-IgKgTcHkU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=26&t=1713s) - Chapter 4. Factoring Consent into Committing Suicide
	- If suicide involves the killing of the Self, and since the Self is the one acting here, consent has automatically been factored in.
	- Violent combat sports factor in consent in a structured manner to harm people, also in a structured manner.
	- A self-sacrifice involving a soldier jumping on a live grenade to save five others. How is this act of consented suicide morally legitimate?
	- Can a fully-informed individual with the capability to consent, attempt suicide in a morally justifiable manner?
- [41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-IgKgTcHkU&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&index=26&t=2477s) - Chapter 5. Summary and Conclusion
	- Why blindly accept the status quo on what Life is and what Death could be?
	- Humans are machines capable of so much and possess the ability to reflect on their abilities.
		- How is death then, different from othe machines breaking down?
	- Fear is an inappropriate response to Death, though some mixed emotions are indeed a given, for such an intense experience.
	- As one has the right to Live with dignity, one should also have the right to Die with dignity.
